				<p>Johnny Depp's first movies was a film called A Nightmare on Elm Street. Personally I do not like scary movies, however this film was what made Depp's career jump out to fame. It is an American film produced in 1984, it was written and directed by Wes Craven. Johnny Depp was considered to be one of the four teenagers that lived on a street located in Ohio. This film at a estimated budget cost to be at least $1.8 million. In auditions to this movie, Depp decided to attend and was accepted to be one of the main characters in the movie. The producers were touched by the way he acted and the naturality that he had, they said that he "had tiny features of a hero". As a result Depp got the role of Glen, which eventually gained the views of alot more fame coming his way.</p>

				<p>Edward Siccorhands is a movie that was brought out in 1990, it is based on a dark romantic fantasy film directed by Tim Burton. Depp is portrayed as a young man named Edward who is an unfinished creation with scissor hands. Throughout this movie, he is brought to a home in a suburban area in where he falls in love with thier teenage daughter, Kim. Burton (the director) always tended to go towards Johnny Depp when wanting to film this movie. He had seen him acting and rising in his popular performance in 21-Jump Street. When Depp knew that he was getting the opportunity to be "Edward" he felt very special; the reason why is because he connected very much emotionally with the character. Feeling left out was something that was always a problem when he was younger.</p>
