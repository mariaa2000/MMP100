				<p>Johnny Depp's first movies was a film called A Nightmare on Elm Street. Personally I do not like scary movies, however this film was what made Depp's career jump out to fame. It is an American film produced in 1984, it was written and directed by Wes Craven. Johnny Depp was considered to be one of the four teenagers that lived on a street located in Ohio. This film at a estimated budget cost to be at least $1.8 million. In auditions to this movie, Depp decided to attend and was accepted to be one of the main characters in the movie. The producers were touched by the way he acted and the naturality that he had, they said that he "had tiny features of a hero". As a result Depp got the role of Glen, which eventually gained the views of alot more fame coming his way.</p>
